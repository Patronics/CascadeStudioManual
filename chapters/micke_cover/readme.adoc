= This chapter describes an example to produce a cover for the IKEA Micke desk. 

== Introduction



== Create a model for a cover
The 3D model for the cover of the cable opening can be produced easily with CascadeStudio. The cover consists of the base shape that fits into the opening and a cover or lid. 

[source,javascript]
----
// Base shape
let outerRadius = 35;
let baseHeight = 10;
let baseShape = Cylinder(outerRadius, baseHeight,false);
let baseRounded = FilletEdges(baseShape,1,[2]);

// Lid shape
let lidWidth = 10;
let lidHeight = 3;
let lidFillet = 1;
let lid = Translate([0,0,baseHeight], Cylinder(outerRadius+lidWidth, lidHeight, false))
let lidRounded = FilletEdges(lid, lidFillet,[0]);

// make the base hollow
let baseThickness = 1.5;
let holeRadius = outerRadius - baseThickness;
let hole = Cylinder(holeRadius, 40, true);

let hollowBase = Difference(baseRounded, [hole], false);
Union([hollowBase,lidRounded]);

== Export the 3D model to STL-format



== Import the model into PrusaSlicer

* import the STL
* place the cover with the top flat on the print bed


== Add a modifier to the center of the cover

* right click and select "Add modifier", then choose Cylinder
* scale the cylinder so that it covers the middle part of the cover
* with the modifier selected, choose
